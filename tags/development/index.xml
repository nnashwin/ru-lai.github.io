      <description>On August 23, 2013, I left the United States Navy after fulfilling a 6-year contract.
Shortly afterwards, a mentor told me about programming. He mentioned I should look into attending a development boot camp. Coincidentally, a programming boot camp opened where we lived.
Knowing nothing about programming, I applied to the program and was accepted. In January of 2014, I began a three-month programming course focused on teaching full stack web development.</description>

      <description>Behind all great individuals is a core group of people who support them. These people help lobby for their goals and enable them to accomplish more than they thought possible. Recently, while on a Christmas road trip to see my parents, my intermittent fascination with the fighting game community (FGC) led me to stumble upon an interview showcasing true support. The title character is a personality in the FGC named Mike Ross.</description>

      <description>The learner&#39;s work desk  One of the most rewarding (and challenging) things you can do as a developer is to implement something you’ve never done before.
It’s even harder to is implement something you have never done before while on a deadline. The pressure of needing to get work done in a specific time frame can add more stress to the already difficult challenge of finding an optimal solution to a new problem.</description>

      <description>The Beginning   I didn’t start out in this world happy.
When I was young I felt different from most people. I would check out mentally at school, not want to play with friends, and spend a lot of my time watching TV and wishing I was someone else.
Most of my distress early on resulted from my mother’s passing away when I was four-and-a-half. Two years later more was added on when my father chose to remarry a physically and emotionally abusive woman.</description>
