<p>I didn’t start out in this world happy.</p>

<p>When I was young I felt different from most people. I would check out mentally at school, not want to play with friends, and spend a lot of my time watching TV and wishing I was someone else.</p>

<p>Most of my distress early on resulted from my mother’s passing away when I was four-and-a-half. Two years later more was added on when my father chose to remarry a physically and emotionally abusive woman. From the ages six to 14 I felt my life was constantly on edge, like every move I made and every word I said would cause my stepmother to explode and vent her anger on me.</p>

<p>I knew how it felt to be walking on eggshells before I even knew the phrase existed. Although I tried many times to tell my father how bad things were at home when he would work late, his hesitation in leaving my stepmom resulted in my living in desperation and anxiety which I thought would never come to an end.</p>

<p>But it did. Right after my 14th birthday, my father made the best decision for us and left my stepmom to take a job six hours away. I thought then that that period of time must be the greatest that life had to offer, and I often dreamed of how much better of a life we would lead and how happy I would be now that we left what I believed was the only problem in my life.</p>

<p>Life was certainly better, but I realized I personally had some issues that were unresolved.
<br>
<br></p>

<h2 id="freedom-isn-t-free">Freedom Isn’t Free</h2>

<p>I couldn’t handle the freedom. After eight years of intense pressure and living in survival mode, even going to sleep at the correct time proved too difficult for me. I would often stay up late into the night wasting time playing video games to abate a sense of loneliness and uncertainty I felt in my life.</p>

<p>This lasted all the way through high school, where I spent most of my time socializing and partying. Like a prisoner who doesn’t know what to do with his freedom after staying in jail for a long time, I found it extremely difficult to handle being a young adult. By the time I was halfway through my senior year of high school, I knew it was time for a change.</p>

<p>Around this time I met a Navy recruiter full of promises of learning, excellence, and the opportunity to “Accelerate My Life” by enlisting in the United States Navy. All I knew at that time was that at some point in the future I would be sent to a school in California to learn Chinese for a year and a half. I thought the military would help me manage the decision paralysis I experienced some Friday nights when there was no one around and I didn’t know what to do.</p>

<p>The Navy didn’t entirely disappoint. But it also didn’t solve many of the internal problems I still struggled with.</p>

<p>The Navy did introduce me to Chinese, however, which ultimately led me to try to learn how to study better. The experiences I had learning Chinese taught me that the way I spend my free time will ultimately determine my opportunities in the future. And it was about this time that I happened upon a language learning blog/money making scheme that introduced me to Spaced Repetition.
<br>
<br></p>

<h2 id="a-first-taste">A First Taste</h2>

<p>I was passionate about learning Chinese from the beginning. When I was in school, I spent anywhere from 10–14 hours a day immersed in the language. Trying to use the same method to learn Chinese that I had used to learn English, I bought a TV box that played Chinese TV broadcasts over the internet. I spent hours after class trying to piece together exactly what was happening in the shows. My path to fluency could be described as an arduous process, but my passion and curiosity drove me to new language learning heights.</p>

<p>Even though I was spending so much time studying and becoming proficient in this language, I always felt a thread of doubt about my language learning process. There seemed to be something missing from the experience, and I was afraid that after our training program was over I would lose all of what I had worked so hard to obtain.

<h2 id="independent-review">Independent Review</h2>

<p><blockquote>

<p>The main problem I encountered during self study was independent review. I discovered that when you are taking a formal class, review, note-taking, and testing are required parts of the curriculum. Vocabulary, explicit grammar structures, and culture knowledge are built into the curriculum itself, so as long as you show up to class and pay attention, your level will be roughly where that of the class is. This type of review may not always be the most efficient way of learning material, but it works for the inner ecosystem of the particular class you’re in.</p>

<p>But the rules are thrown away when you try to learn on your own.</p>

<p>I started trying to teach myself by writing down all the new words and phrases I learned in a list, and I would review the list until I was familiar with them. A problem I discovered while using this method was that after enough time, the words on the list would become unmanageable, and I would forget which words I added when. If you want to learn enough, the challenge with teaching yourself is not motivating yourself to study, but rather organizing WHAT you should study and planning the correct timing.

</figure></p>

<p>When your reviews are not structured in the class, how do you review enough to keep improving? Which words should you review and at what times?</p>

<p>Forgetting is a necessary evil in language learning, but sometimes words I had written down or tried to learn a few months in the past would show up again on my lists. And often I would remember that I had “learned” words before, but I still wouldn’t know them when I encountered them again.</p>

<p>At the time, I didn’t have the mathematical know-how to analyze exactly how many of these words I would restudy, but I know it was more than I was comfortable with. Around five or six years ago, I felt I didn’t have a good handle on my individual learning, so I started to research language learning blogs to get ideas on how to learn more efficiently.
<br>
<br></p>

<h2 id="the-introduction">The Introduction</h2>

<p>I eventually happened upon a blog post describing my exact situation. It listed many of the problems I just described to you: independent study, too many words or lists to organize, and even time management and motivation. It was everything I was looking for. In one post it used a metaphor for memory that I think is easy to understand.

</figure></p>

<p>The post described a model called the “The Leaky Bucket Theory.” This model compares human memory to a bucket that is slowly leaking water. If you don’t refill the bucket, you’ll eventually lose all of the water (proficiency/knowledge). The only way you can maintain even something close to a full bucket of water is by filling it back up again. But even when you do that, you still can’t stop the bucket from leaking water. The more I read on, the more anxious I felt. Was there really no way to remember information without killing yourself and spending six hours a day filling up your bucket with water?</p>

<p>The end of the article filled me with hope. The author mentioned a piece of software that could solve this problem.</p>

<p>Someone had invented a way to optimally plan your reviews for you. I learned that this software was called Spaced Repetition System (SRS) software, and in order to learn with it the only thing you needed was a computer.</p>

<p>Details about how to learn were left out of the article, but the message was clear: using this method could solve the Leaky Bucket problem. Or at least make the bucket leak less.</p>

<p>Using an SRS is the equivalent of holding a tray under the bucket. Every now and then, based on a scientific algorithm which calculated the pattern by which the brain forgets information (<a href="https://www.wired.com/2008/04/ff-wozniak">which is roughly the same for everyone</a>), the tray full of leaky water is dumped back into the bucket.</p>

<p>You may think, what is the difference between the tray water and new water in the bucket? It’s still going to leak out at the same rate, right? Not exactly. Each time the leaked water is dumped back into the bucket, the longer that type of water will stay in the bucket. In our brains, if we review information at the correct time, that piece of information will be forgotten at an interval much longer than before. This process describes how our short-term memories are turned into long-term memories, and explains why even though you have forgotten most of what you learned in high school, there are still some random facts you will remember even
though they might not be important to your everyday life.</p>

<p>The beauty of this method is that all you have to do is learn something, put the new information you want to learn into the software, and be sure you show up every day to complete your reviews.

<h2 id="total-life-makeover">Total Life Makeover</h2>

<p>They say that repetition is the secret behind habits. I’m not quite sure who they are, but I know that my consistent use of Spaced Repetition enabled me to change my life dramatically.</p>

<p>What spaced repetition did for me is to give me the proper structure at the proper time. No longer did I have to plan on my review sessions — I now had an automatic, scientific, and efficient way to incrementally program new vocabulary and concepts into my brain. My learning through SRS expanded from individual vocabulary words to sentences, and to other topics I needed to learn in my life. Later on, I went meta and began to learn concepts about learning and found myself able to learn faster and more efficiently.</p>

<p>My biggest gains came from reading through and learning self-development literature. Knowing that I had some weaknesses I had never really learned to accept, I started to research and insert self-development literature into my SRS. Soft skills, habits, quotes, and memories I didn’t want to forget found their way into my deck to be forever sealed into an ever-increasing (at least until I die) log of my knowledge and my life. The structure I required to lead a better life had been established, and I slowly but surely found myself able to recognize my individual problems, and I began to take action in resolving them.</p>

<p>The craziest thing about the whole process was that it just worked. Even though my cards aren’t perfect, the algorithm remains solid. Previous habits which prevented me from attaining higher levels of fulfillment and held me back from deeper relationships became more obvious. Huge blocks of time I previously wasted by not consciously identifying and working towards my goals were regained. SRS hasn’t enabled me to become perfect by any means, but each mistake I make can become a lesson I can recall throughout my life for the rest of my life, or at least for so long as I deem it important.</p>

<p>My life has been changed by committing to reviewing cards every day. The knowledge I’ve gained from this endeavor has allowed me to improve every aspect of my life, and I recommend everyone give it a try!</p>
