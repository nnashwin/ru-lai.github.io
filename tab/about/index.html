I didn&rsquo;t start this journey always knowing what I loved to do, I have just slowly started to find it.
A long time ago, I remember I talked to a friendly neighbor and asked him how he knew what he wanted to do when he grew up.
He laughed and told me he still didn&rsquo;t know.
I didn&rsquo;t quite understand what that meant at the time.  But now that I have been able to learn many things, live in many places, and work a few different jobs, I kind of understand.
<br>
The other day, one of my coworkers asked how I knew what I wanted to build and what I wanted to do.
I told him I didn&rsquo;t and remembered my neighbor.
<br><br>
This blog is a collection of all I&rsquo;ve been able to find out while exploring my own small segment of the world.
I&rsquo;ll try to find out how I can contribute the most value and write it down here.</p>
